# Authentication Implementation Guide

## Overview

This document provides information about the authentication implementation in the Zaymazone project. The authentication system has been connected to the MongoDB database, allowing users to register, login, and manage their profiles.

## Features Implemented

- User registration with MongoDB database storage
- User login with token-based authentication
- Protected routes that require authentication
- Role-based access control (buyer/seller)
- User profile management
- Password update functionality

## Implementation Details

### Client-Side

1. **Authentication Store**: Updated `authStore.js` to use API calls for login and signup
2. **Authentication Check**: Added `useAuthCheck.js` hook to verify token on app load
3. **Protected Routes**: Implemented `ProtectedRoute.jsx` and `RoleBasedRoute.jsx` components
4. **Profile Management**: Created `ProfilePage.jsx` for users to view and edit their profiles
5. **Navigation**: Updated Navbar to include profile management links

### Server-Side

1. **User Routes**: Enhanced `/api/users` routes with proper authentication
2. **Authentication Middleware**: Implemented `authMiddleware.js` with `protect` and `restrictTo` functions
3. **Token Generation**: Added token generation for login and registration
4. **Profile Updates**: Implemented secure profile and password updates

## Testing the Authentication

### Using the Test Script

1. Make sure your server is running:
   ```
   cd server
   npm start
   ```

2. In a separate terminal, start the client:
   ```
   npm run dev
   ```

3. Open the test HTML file in your browser:
   ```
   open test-auth.html
   ```
   Or simply double-click the file in your file explorer.

4. Click the "Run Tests" button to execute the authentication tests.

### Manual Testing

1. **Registration**: Visit `/signup` and create a new account
2. **Login**: Visit `/login` and sign in with your credentials
3. **Profile**: After logging in, click on your profile picture and select "Edit Profile"
4. **Dashboard**: Access your role-specific dashboard (buyer or seller)

## Security Considerations

- Passwords are currently stored in plain text for simplicity. In a production environment, you should use bcrypt for password hashing.
- The token implementation is simplified. In a production environment, use a proper JWT implementation with expiration and refresh tokens.
- Add CSRF protection for production use.
- Implement rate limiting to prevent brute force attacks.

## Next Steps

1. Implement password hashing with bcrypt
2. Add email verification
3. Implement password reset functionality
4. Add OAuth providers (Google, Facebook, etc.)
5. Enhance security with proper JWT implementation
